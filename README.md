## Installation
To run locally, users must install all required NPM packages (Axios, bootstrap, react, react-dom, react-scripts). This application starts in a terminal window. To run the application, open a new terminal window, and type “npm start” to start the application. This will run a react server, and a new window will open with the running application on localhost:3000.


## Usage
Once running, users will be presented with a home page that states a brief summary of my work experience, education, hobbies and future pursuits.  From that page, useres can connect to two other pages using the links on th home page.  One is my portfolio, and the other is my contact page.
